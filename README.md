**MATLAB Theme Extensions** enhances MATLABâ€™s built-in themes by enabling users to create, import, and share custom color themes. This extension allows you to personalize your MATLAB environment and easily switch between different color schemes.

### Features
1. Import custom color scheme from JSON files, (e.g., the Cobalt scheme):
```matlab
import_scheme('schemes/cobalt.json');
```
2. Export your current color settings along with MATLAB Theme to a JSON file.
```matlab
export_scheme('exampleCustomColors.json');
```

The project works by customizing colors on top of the existing MATLAB Themes (either Light or Dark).

### Scheme File Structure

Scheme files are JSON documents that must include a `DesktopTheme` field and follow the structure of the provided [template.json](./template.json) in this project. Customizable fields include:
- Background Color
- Text Color
- MATLAB Syntax Highlighting Colors
- Output Colors
- Programming Tools
- Syntax Highlighting for other languages such as C, Java, HTML, etc.
- Current Line Highlight
- Right-hand Text limit line
- Boolean fields to enable or disable specific customizations

The fields in the JSON file are inspired from MATLAB's Settings panel.
